        All files listed in the Table of Contents share the file type.
        - URI (required):
        The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI, as defined by http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) is the only required attribute. 
        For files that are required to interpret the contents of the ACS container, the URI shall be in the form of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) 
        that is based on one of the "file", "http", "https", or "ftp" schemes. The "file" scheme shall only be used to reference files within the container. 
        In these cases, the container itself is understood as the local file system. The slash character shall be used to indicate the root of the container 
        and to separate directories in the file path. File-based URLs referring to the "local" file system outside of the container 
        (e.g., "file://C:\My Documents\FCS\file1.fcs") shall NOT be used in any case. Examples of conformant URLs: file:///data1.fcs, file:///sample2/a08.fcs
        The "http", "https", or "ftp" schemes should be used to reference files outside of the container. It should be possible to dereference these URLs globally 
        (i.e., localhost-based URLs shall NOT be used). 
        URLs based on other than "file", "http", "https", or "ftp" schemes and URNs may only be used for files that are not required to interpret the 
        contents of the ACS container, e.g., urn:issn:1552-4957.
        - mimeType, optional:
        The name of the format that the file is saved in. Usage of the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Media Type is recommended for the value 
        of the format attribute if possible, See http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/. 
        Examples: "application/vnd.isac.fcs", "application/dicom", "application/postscript", "application/msword", "application/pdf", 
        "application/netCDF", "image/bmp", "image/gif", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2", "image/png", "image/svg+xml", "image/tiff".
        "application/vnd.treestar.flowJo-ws+xml", "application/vnd.isac.gating-ml+xml"
        - description (optional):
        A free text description of the file.
        - associated (optional):
        The "associated" element may be used to provide references to information about the file stored in other files. Essentially, all metadata relations 
        shall be provided using the "associated" element with the "with" and "associationType" required attributes.
        - additional_info (optional):
        The additional_info element may include additional information about the file in structured form.

        Description of the type of an association. 
        - with (required):
        A URI [RFC-3986, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt] of the target resource (file) of the association. The URI shall follow the same rules as specified for 
        the "file" element. In addition, a URI fragment identifier as defined by the general URI syntax [RFC-3986] may be used to reference part of a resource. 
        A fragment identifier component is indicated by the presence of a number sign ('#') character and terminated by the end of the URI. 
        For example, file:///gates/gating1.xml#gate1 references a specific gate within a Gating-ML file; file:///gates/gating1.xml#spillm references a specific 
        spillover matrix within a Gating-ML file.
        - associationType (required):
        The type of the association.  If possible, one of the pre-defined association types should be used. 
        If there is no suitable association type for your association in the ISAC registry, please submit a new association type to the 
        ISAC Data Standards Task Force; see http://www.isac-net.org for contact details and the updated contents of the registry. 
        See the specification PDF for the contents of the association types registry of as of the date of this document.
